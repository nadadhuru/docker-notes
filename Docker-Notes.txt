	Develop
	Deploy
	Run

What is containerization?
Use of Linux Containers (LIX) to deploy applications is called Containerization.

What are advantages of containerization or why is containerization is popular?

    Flexible: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
    Lightweight: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
    Interchangeable: You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
    Portable: You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
    Scalable: You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
    Stackable: You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.

What is a container?
its a runtime instance of an image that shares the kernel of host machine. Its runs as discrete process.
It runs natively on linux and shares the kernel with other containers

Whatis an image?
Its an executable package that contains everything needed (libraries, code, environment variables, config files) to run an application.

How to view list of running containers?
docker ps

State differences b/w VM and Container?


How to check Docker version?
docker --version

How to check Docker installation info?
docker run
or
docker version

How to test your docker installation?
By running hello-world program as mentioned below:

docker run hello-world

How to view list of images downloaded to your local?
docker images ls

How to list all containers?
docker container ls -all

What is the hirerachy in Docker?

	Stack
		services
			Containers

What is a docker file?
Portable images are defined by something called a "Dockerfile"
Dockerfile contains the information about your container environment such as Files, Network, Storage Volumes etc.

What are components in Dockerfile?
	FROM:		This defines which PARENT image to base from.
	WORKDIR:	
	COPY:		Use this to place any files inside a container at a specific folder. However files need to be placed in same folder as Dockerfile
	Run:		Any installations you need. E.g. Yum install vim or you can pass a file yum install -r filename
	EXPOSE:		Used for specifying port#
	ENV:		Define any environment variables
	CMD:		

How to create an image using Docker?

	docker build --tag=<nameofimage>

	docker build -t=<nameofimage>

How to set port?
	docker run -p <newport>:<defaultport> <containername>
	You should see a message that Python is serving your app at http://0.0.0.0:80. 
	But that message is coming from inside the container, which doesn’t know you mapped port 80 of that container to 4000, making the correct URL http://localhost:4000.
	
How to find IP address using Docker?
	docker-machine ip

Where is Docker config file located?
	its available in /etc/docker/daemon.json

How to set a DNS address?
	Add following line to docker config file.
	{
		"dns": ["your_dns_address", "8.8.8.8"]
	}
	
	Note:	Always make sure to restart Docker after updating config file.

How to specify if you use a proxy server for connecting?
	Proxy servers can block connections to your web app once it’s up and running. If you are behind a proxy server, add the following lines to your Dockerfile.
	Use ENV command and specify the Host and Port in the docker file.
	# Set proxy server, replace host:port with values for your servers
		ENV http_proxy host:port
		ENV https_proxy host:port

How to start/stop/restart Docker?
	service docker <start/stop/restart>

How to run an app in detached or background mode?
	docker run -d <containername>

How to stop a container? (Not DOCKER)
	docker container <stop> <containerid>

What is docker registry? & repository?
	A registry is a collection of repositories, and a repository is a collection of images

How do you setup your Private Registery?
	Using Docker Trusted Regsitry, you can setup your own registry for storing images.

How many repositories you can create in a Registry?
	Unlimited

What is the registry used by docker?
	Docker uses Docker's public registry by default

How do you login into Docker Hub?
	docker login
